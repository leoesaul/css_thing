        <p class="article">Here is the first page of my second project for school, web-development course.
            I've spent plenty of time, trying to figure out, how to make this page look like exactly how
            I wanted it to look like. Tautology, ha-ha. 
        </p>
        <p class="article">I hope it can be said I've done a great job creating something like 
            article website. But, I see, for the website to be an article website it must contain some
            article-editing tools. I am not sure I'm going to implement them now, because I need some servers
            to make it, to store whole info, to run this code like always... 
            It concerns some google ads left and right also, so I think 
            I'm going to put some pictures instead and let them slide with you as blocks.
        </p>
        <p class="article">I'm not a good designer, I can not create some good-looking solutions...
            Nevertheless I am able to develop them all, just give me a bit of time.
